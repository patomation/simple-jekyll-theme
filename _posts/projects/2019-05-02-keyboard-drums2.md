Just make a decision and let it go. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We wash our brush with odorless thinne

Something about the project?



Perhaps some code....
```javascript
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      playing: false,
      progress: 0
    };
    this.audio = new Audio(this.props.audioPath);
    this.audio.addEventListener('playing', (event) => {})
    this.audio.addEventListener('ended', (event) => {})
    //Start audio progress checker
    this._getProgressChecker();
  }
```

How about some Bob Ross Lipsums

Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Son of a gun.

La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.

A beautiful little sunset. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Take your time. Speed will come later. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

This is the fun part A big strong tree needs big strong roots. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. There we are.

Just make a decision and let it go. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We wash our brush with odorless thinner.
